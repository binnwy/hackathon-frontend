# === Hackthon Project Rules ===

# Framework & Setup
- Always use Vite + React (JavaScript).
- Styling must use TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui components.
- Do not create raw CSS files unless absolutely required.

# Components
- Prefer shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Table, etc.).
- Use Tailwind classes for layout, spacing, colors.
- Do not use inline styles unless absolutely necessary.

# Pages
- Project has 3 main pages:
  1. Landing Page (Hero + Features + Footer)
  2. Dashboard (Charts + Starfield Animation)
  3. Detail Page (Card + Table + Info)

# Libraries
- react-router-dom for routing.
- framer-motion for animations.
- react-chartjs-2 + chart.js for charts.
- react-tsparticles for starfield background.

# Deployment
- Assume Netlify as deployment target.
- Must keep build command as `npm run build`.

# Code Quality
- Keep code modular: components go in `src/components/`, pages in `src/pages/`.
- Use functional components only (no class components).
- Always prefer reusable components (e.g., ChartCard instead of repeating code).

# Special Notes
- Project name is "hackthon".
- Theme: Dark background (gray-900 / black) + white text.
- Must run with `npm run dev` without errors before deployment.
